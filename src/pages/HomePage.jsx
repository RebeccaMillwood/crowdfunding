            <p>The dog-owner seeks out a dog-walker in their location and pledges 
                the number of hours their dog is available to be walked for the month.</p>

                have been achieved for the month; dog-owner can see the total number of hours their 
                dog has been walked on an individual level, and dog-lover can see if they meet their 
                target hours of monthly walks.</p>
